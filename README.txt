**Simple & Easy To Use Virtual Tour Builder**

WPVR has a simple interface, designed to create virtual tours real quickly, without any expertise.

>In fact, you can create a simple virtual tour in less than 5 minutes!!

On top of that, you can customize the tour further using auto-rotation effect, scene fade animation when transmitting between scenes, Gyroscope support on mobile devices, and many more, to make the tour more attractive.

You may also use interactive hotspots to display information and keep your viewers engaged.

The best part of this plugin is, you will get a live tour preview at the back-end so that you can see what you are creating on the go.

Even if you're new to this, you will still be able to create virtual tours on your own, thanks to the actionable video tutorials and step-by-step instructions in our documentation.

>Read detailed [documentation](https://rextheme.com/docs/wp-vr/) and [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLelDqLncNWcUndi1NkXJh2BH62OYmIayt) for assistance.

**Create An Interactive Realistic Tour With Multiple Panoramic Images**

You can add multiple 360-degree images in a virtual tour to create scenes, and connect them through scene type hotspots.

Viewers can click on the hotspots to move back and forth between the scenes.

> You can connect up to 5 scenes, and add 5 hotspots per scene on a virtual tour. To create tours with unlimited scenes and hotspots, [click here](https://rextheme.com/wpvr)

**Interactive Hotspots To Create More Attraction**

You can use engaging hotspots to view on-click or on-hover contents that include:

*Texts
*Images
*GIFs
*URLs
*Videos
*Buttons

Also, you will get over 900+ custom icons for hotspots which you can further customize with color and ripple animation. A great way to grab your viewer's attention.

**A Simple Tool For 360 Experience**

Whether you run a travel blog, or sell properties as a realtor, a virtual tour will make your site more interactive. Even just viewing a simple scene with one 360 degree image will add extra value.

And WPVR is currently the most reliable plugin to help you out with this. You may choose to use it as a simple 360 photo viewer, or create a high quality virtual tour with all the features without any complications.

**A Functional 360 Video Viewer**

When you have a 360 camera, you will be able to capture 360 degree apartment videos  which is amazing.

Once you embed the 360 degree videos on your site, your visitors can navigate within the video, while it plays.

You may upload your 360 video content to Youtube, Vimeo, or your website, and then embed the video on any page within your site using WPVR.

**Embed Virtual Tours In Just A Few Clicks**

Once you create a tour, it’s really easy to embed it on your website.

Whether you use Gutenberg Editor or Popular page builders, WPVR comes with dedicated blocks and widgets to save you time when embedding your tour on your site.

| WPVR Gutenberg block | WPVR Elementor widget | Visual Composer Element | Oxygen Builder Element

If you use any other page builder, you can still publish the tour by using a shortcode, which is generated after you publish the tour.

**Use High Quality Images Without WordPress Restriction**

A good quality 360 panorama usually comes with very high resolution that can easily go over 3000 x 1500 pixels.

However, WordPress has the default large image handler which usually resizes images to below 2560 x 1280 pixels when you upload the image.

WPVR comes with the option to disable this restriction so that you can easily upload panoramic images that can be more that 3000 pixels in width.

**Mobile First VR Approach**

WPVR is designed with a mobile-friendly output in mind and all the tours you make will be fully responsive and weightless for mobile devices.

Simply enable the Auto-resize feature for mobile phones so that a lighter version of your panoramic images are generated. These are then used to view virtual tours on mobile devices.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=1. Why Do I Need WP VR?=

You can easily create a Virtual Tour of your place using WP VR to build a virtual presence of your business.

Simply provide a 360 degree panoramic photo and this plugin will create a virtual tour that your visitors can navigate easily.

Allow your prospects to have a realistic tour of your facility before they decide to purchase your service and increase your conversion rate.

=2. How to Install and Activate WP VR?=

Once you have downloaded the file, go to your dashboard. Under Plugins, select Add New, and upload the file. Then Install and activate the plugin.

Once activated, on the left side under your dashboard, you will find the option WP VR at the bottom.

=3. What Kind of Images Should I Use To Create A Virtual Tour?=

To make a perfect equirectangular image, you need to use a 360-degree panoramic photo of the area you want to preview.

However, you can also capture panorama images with your smartphone and use them to create a partial panorama tour.

=5. Can I Customize The Hotspot Icons?=

Yes. You can create a custom class on your theme, stating whatever style you want. 

Then you can input the class name on the Hotspot Custom Class section in a hotspot, and the content displayed will be customized according to the style you set.

=6. Can I Create A 360 Degree Video Tour With WP VR?=

Yes, with WP VR, you can create a 360 Degree video tour.

You can either upload the video to create a tour or set a link to a Youtube/Vimeo 360 degree video.

=7. How To Embed A Virtual Tour Using Gutenberg Block Editor?=

Under common blocks, you will find a block called WP VR. Select the block and on the dynamic toolbar on the right, you will get the options to add ID, Height, and Width.

Collect the ID from the virtual tour you created. Assign the height and width as you desire.

=8. The Tour Is Not Loading On The Webpage.=

Go to your WordPress Dashboard > WPVR > Get Started > Settings.

Check the Enable Script Control option status.

If the Enable Script Control option is turned On, turn it off and reload the tour page.

If you wish to use this feature, you have to set the URLs of all the pages on your site with a virtual tour in the List of Allowed Pages To Load WPVR Scripts field.

=9. What To Do If I Get “THE FILE (image link) COULD NOT BE ACCESSED” Error?=

Sometimes when you add a tour on your site, you might face this issue that rather than loading the tour it will give the error “THE FILE (…) COULD NOT BE ACCESSED.”

This error shows up when you are running a website under “HTTPS” (secured with SSL certificate) whereas your image link is under “HTTP” (unsecured).

To solve this issue, go to your WordPress Dashboard > Settings > General. Here make sure you have “https” added to both “WordPress Address (URL)” and “Site Address (URL)”. That’s it. Your virtual tour will load with no issues.

=10. Can I make The Virtual Tour Full-width?=

Yes, you can publish the tours as full-width of your page/post.

For Gutenberg, Elementor, and Oxygen builder, set fullwidth on the Width field. For shortcodes, set width = “fullwidth”.

=11. What If I Use An Optimization or Caching Plugin?=

If you use any Optimization or Caching plugins, then you need to exclude WP VR from its optimization function.

Simply add “/plugins/wpvr” to the exclusion field (or use the location where you store plugins).

=12. Can I Allow The Users of My Site To Create Virtual Tours?=

You can only allow the backend users like Admins, Editors, and Authors of your site to create virtual tours.

Admins & editors will have access to all virtual tours on the site to modify, update and delete them.

Authors can access their own tours only and modify, update, or delete them.

Admins can remove the access from Authors and Editors at any time.
